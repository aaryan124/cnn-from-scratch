# CNN from Scratch

This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch using NumPy.  
It includes convolution, max-pooling, dense layers

ðŸ§  Built for learning purposes â€” no external deep learning libraries used.

## Features
- Conv2D with stride and padding
- MaxPooling
- Dense Layer
- ReLU & Softmax activations
- Cross-entropy loss
- Manual backpropagation

## Dataset
Tested on MNIST (28x28 handwritten digits).

## Usage
Run the `.ipynb` notebook to train the model.
