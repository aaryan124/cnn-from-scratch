# Neural Networks from Scratch (NumPy)

This repository contains core deep learning architectures â€” **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **CNN** â€” implemented completely from scratch using **NumPy**, without any deep learning libraries.

ðŸ§  Built for learning purposes.  
ðŸ“š Project purpose: To study and understand the internals of deep learning models through hands-on implementation.
